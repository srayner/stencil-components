# Stencil Components

Just playing around with stencil.js

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srayner/stencil-components.git
cd stencil-components
npm install
```

To start dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```
